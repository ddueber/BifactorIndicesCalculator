DESCRIPTION text was fixed as requested - no unexplained acronyms. 

\dontrun is used in the example for the "bifactorIndicesMPlus" function because some of my current users about it not needing input. When the "bifactorIndicesMPlus" function is called, file.choose() is called so that the user can select a file from their computer (an output file from a program called Mplus). I put this example in so a user would see it and say "oh, all I have to do is call the function with no arguments."
