Description: The calculator computes bifactor indices such as explained common variance (ECV), hierarchical Omega (OmegaH), percentage of uncontaminated correlations (PUC), item explained common variance (I-ECV), and more. This package is an R version of the 'Excel' based 'Bifactor Indices Calculator' (Dueber, 2017)  <doi:10.13023/edp.tool.01> with added convenience features for directly utilizing output from several programs that can fit confirmatory factor analysis or item response models.
